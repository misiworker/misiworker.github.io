    <p>Everyone has his or her answers to 'What is your favorite food?'
        'What is your favorite place?'. If given the opportunity, we would
        choose to eat our favorite food at our favorite place without
        hesitation. Oddly enough, I have the fanatic love for eating
        hamburgers at train station though neither of them is my favorite.
        Train station is a crowded place with stories, countless
        Hi and goodbyes.
        Sitting at train station observing gives me a glance of other
        people's life. It is like a flavor additive to my changeless life.</p>
    <h2>HISTORY OF HAMBURGERS</h2>

    <p>The hamburger, often abbreviated as “burger,” is named after the German city of Hamburg. Neither name derives
        from Ham nor is it an ingredient. Hamburgers first appeared in the 19th or early 20th century.[1][2] The modern
        hamburger was a product of the culinary needs of a society rapidly changing due to industrialization and the
        emergence of the working class and middle class with the resulting demand for mass-produced, affordable food
        that could be consumed outside of the home.
        Considerable evidence suggests the USA was the first country where two slices of bread and a ground beef steak
        were combined into a "hamburger sandwich" and sold. There is some controversy over the origin of the hamburger
        because its two basic ingredients, bread and beef, had been prepared and consumed separately for many years in
        different countries before their combination. Shortly after its creation, the hamburger quickly included all of
        its currently typically characteristic trimmings, including onions, lettuce, and sliced pickles.
        After various controversies in the 20th century, including a nutritional controversy in the late 1990s, the
        burger is now readily identified with the United States, and a particular style of cuisine, namely fast food.[3]
        Along with fried chicken and apple pie, the hamburger has become a culinary icon in the United States.[4][5]
        The hamburger's international popularity demonstrates the larger globalization of food[6] that also includes the
        rise in global popularity of other national dishes, including the (Italian) pizza, and Japanese sushi. The
        hamburger has spread from continent to continent perhaps because it matches familiar elements in different
        culinary cultures.[7] This global culinary culture has been produced, in part, by the concept of selling
        processed food, first launched in the 1920s by the White Castle restaurant chain and its visionary Edgar Waldo
        "Billy" Ingram and then refined by McDonald's in the 1940s.[8][9] This global expansion provides economic points
        of comparison like the Big Mac Index,[10] by which one can compare the purchasing power of different countries
        where the Big Mac hamburger is sold.</p>
